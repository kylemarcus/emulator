#####Emulator Hadoop MapReduce

These files come from Rohit's user directoy on CCR

I believe my\_slurm\_script_ is run first with the map set at map6.py and reduce set as reduce3.py

Then my\_slurm\_script\_for\_final\_reduce is run with the map set again as map6.py and the reduce set at reduce5.py

Note that the emulator is not run inside Hadoop, it is run as a batch process on the cluster before Hadoop is run.
